lissajou.{py,sh} is a very simple application for drawing Lissajou figures
on an oscilloscope running in X-Y mode.

To run it, simply run ./lissajou.sh.

This runs lissajou.py to generate the audio, and then pipes in into aplay to
send it to your sound card.

Controls:

Note: Focus needs to be on the "pygame" window for the controls to work.

q / numpad 7: Left channel frequency up
z / numpad 1: Left channel frequency down
e / numpad 9: Right channel frequency up
c / numpad 3: Right channel frequency down
a / numpad 4: Phase shift "left"
d / numpad 6: Phase shift "right"
x:            Exit

Look in the shell to see the current frequency/phase values.

Future plans:
* Set a sensible window title.
* Display current frequency/phase values in the pygame window.
* Mouse input and on-screen sliders for control.
* Draw the sin waves separately in the pygame window.
* (Probably a separate project) Render the result in X-Y mode like a 'scope.

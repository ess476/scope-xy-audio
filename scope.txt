scope.py is an oscilloscope emulator. Simply pipe a WAV file into it, and it
will render the file for you. For example:

./lissajous.py | ./scope.py

./scope.py < oscillofun.wav

Controls:
Note: Focus needs to be on the "pygame" window for the controls to work.
x: Exit

If you wish to listen to the audio stream at the same time as running
scope.py, try running the following command under Bash:

tee <oscillofun.wav >(./scope.py) | aplay /dev/stdin

While there's plenty of opportunity for A/V synchronization to fail, it works
surprisingly well on my system.

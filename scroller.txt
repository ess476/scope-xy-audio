scroller.py,sh renders audio for an x-y 'scope, to scroll some text across the
screen.

To run it, simply run ./scroller.py. You can pipe the output to either
"scope.py" or "aplay /dev/stdin".

* Full character set, including lower-case, symbols, etc.
* Better clipping
* Logo drawing
* Variable-width fonts
* Dynamic scaling of text
* Rotation
